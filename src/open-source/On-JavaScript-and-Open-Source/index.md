## A Call to Serve

I often have gut feelings that take me quite a while to explain. I like to believe that my gut is trustworthy, but it always helps my understanding of myself to try and explain those feelings. Over the past year I've been feeling more and more compelled to contribute to open source. Just in the past week I've actually realized why that is. My career was built by the open source movement in software development. Now that my professional life is starting to stabalize, I've been feeling an ever increasing urge to help improve the open source community because of the immesurable benefit that it has had on my career and my life. That combined with the fact that we are at a pivitol moment in the history of the open source makes it a very exciting time to be a developer. There are countless obstacles ahead, but I'm confident that the community is up to the challenge.

One particular challenge in the JavaScript open source community has been consuming a lof of my brain cycles recently. If you're a JavaScript developer and I asked you to fill in the blank what would you say?

> JavaScript fat____________

According to google the answer is "fatigue" (or maybe "fat arrow" if ES2015 is on your mind). "JavaScript Fatigue" is such an interesting term to me because _fatigue_ it's the exact opposite of what I feel. I feel an incredible amount of excitement. The JavaScript community is at a critical point in it's history and there are a two unique factors to JavaScript as a language that have contributed to the place where we are and the challenges ahead.

## An Open Source First Language

Back when JavaScript was just a client side language the fact that it's interpreted meant that everything that you built was "open source." As in, anybody could read your code because it was being downloaded uncompiled straight to the browser. I believe that sentiment has translated to the Node community. npm has quickly become the largest package manager on earth, despite server side JavaScript being relatively young and npm being one of the youngest package managers out there.

## Zombie Packages

Having the largest database of open source packages in the world doesn't come without its own challenges. While JavaScript is winning in volume it's losing in stability and ultimately I think that's where the "fatigue" comes from. This is not a new problem. Since the beginning of programming as a profession we as software developers have had to carefuly evaluate the tools that we choose to use. Having such a large number of options, especially with so many poorly supported, abandoned or inflexible options out there its no wonder that some of us are frustrated. It's a horrible feeling when you let yourself get excited about a new tool, project, library, framework, etc. only to find that it's poorly documented, out of date / abandoned, or complete vaporware. As developers we are problem solvers. Our natural reaction is to think "this would be perfect if only X." And so naturally we re-build it with X, but we have a huge blind spot when we estimate in our head the effort that will take. We think in terms of software design patterns and lines of code. Community building, support, updates, documentation, education are all invisible to us when we think about the excitement of starting a new project. [290 thousand packages](npmjs.com) later we find ourselves using the word "fatigue" instead of "excitement".

## The nice thing about standards

Now that we're in this situation some people will get a lot of attention complaining and commiserating. What I'm interested in doing is using the excitement (there is a lot of it) within the JavaScript community to fill in the missing pieces (community building, support, updates, documentation and education) so that we can solve the unique problems that the JavaScript community faces today. Over the past ten years that I've been writing JavaScript I've tried out countless libraries, frameworks and tools. I've use a ton of shitty ones and a handful of great ones. The pattern that has emerged in great tools is that they strike the right balance between excitement and maturity. I say excitement and not hype because people who are excited about a library are excited because they are using it effectively. People who are hyping a library are trying to get you to use it for an alterior motive. But excitement is not enough on its own. The maturity comes from looking at the bigger picture and longevity. How will this thing continue to be supported over the next five years? Who is going to take on the responsibility of building an inclusive community around it? How are we going to educate new developers on how to use it, or more importantly how to evaluate whether or not they should be using it in the first place?
